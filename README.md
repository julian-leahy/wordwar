# Word War

## Yep, it's basically Boogle against the computer! 
### Its addictive, challenging and lots fun!

Choose from 3 levels of difficulty, play 3 rounds each one lasting 3 minutes, 3 times (actually you can play as much as you like but I clearly had something going on with the 3 thing).

After each round you can see all the words you missed and it's usually a lot, more than I care to admit!

I still can't beat it on the expert level and I built the damn thing - I think computers may have the edge on this one - go figure!

The dictionary I use is not 100% but pretty close, unfortunately the odd word it didn't contain was still not enough to push the win in my favour.

Set the game to the easy level and let the kids play - you will soon see them cast their XBoxes aside for many, many seconds (I find usually 180 ... ah yes 3 minutes!).
